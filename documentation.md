Analizo was created by Antonio Terceiro as a support tool for his PhD thesis.
Analizo was initially based on [egypt](http://www.gson.org/egypt/) by Andreas
Gustafsson, but currently very little of egypt's code is left.
Analizo has been co-developed by Antonio Terceiro, Joenio Costa, João Miranda
and Paulo Meirelles. The work on Analizo has been supported by the following
organizations:

   * [LES-UFBA](http://les.dcc.ufba.br/)
