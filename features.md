* Analyze source code in C, C++, Java and C#. Support for other languages is
  relatively easy to add. Currently this task is executed by the Doxyparse.

* Extract source code metrics. analizo supports 15+ modules metrics, 7+ project
  metrics, and descriptive statistics for all module metrics.

* Extract metrics from a large number of projects in batch mode. You put all
  the projects you want to analyze in one directoty and analizo takes care of
  the rest.

* Extract metrics from VCS repositories. Analizo can give you the evolution of
  metrics values associated with change metadata for the entire history of your
  project.

* Draw dependency graphs. With the help of Graphviz, analizo will help you with
  the visualization of the dependencies between modules in our project.

* Help you with software evolution analysis. Analizo can analyze several
  versions of your project producing an evolution matrix, which help you
  understand what happens with your code through time.
